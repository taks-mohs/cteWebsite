            For Moanalua High School, Career and Technological Education (CTE) is all about empowering students with the knowledge and skills they need to thrive in the modern workforce.

            These programs often include opportunities for internships, apprenticeships, and industry certifications, giving students a competitive edge in the job market. By participating in CTE, students gain a deeper understanding of their career interests, build a professional network, and acquire the skills needed to succeed in today's dynamic and evolving job landscape. Overall, Career and Technological Education provides a valuable foundation for students to achieve their career goals, contribute to the economy, and lead fulfilling, productive lives.
